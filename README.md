# assistantbot
It is a voice controlled assistant bot which performs basic services like sending mail,opens web browser,search something on wikipedia for you,it will tell you jokes scraped randomly from website and can play music in your computer and you can chat with it also.
Running it is pretty simple just put intention.json file and chatbot.py in the folder and run except part of the program to initialize a pickle file for the very first time after that use it with try and except.
It is still in progress so you can suggest me any change you want to see in it.
I am still learning to make UI using python tkinter so it will take some time to implement it.
